# Pawsistant 🐾

[![HACS Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)
[![HA Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-2024.1%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

A local-only dog activity tracker for Home Assistant. Log walks, bathroom breaks, meals, medications, weight, and more — all stored privately in your HA instance with no cloud dependency.

---

## Features

- **Local storage only** — all data stored in HA's `.storage` directory, no cloud accounts or tokens required
- **Per-event sensors** — most-recent timestamp for each event type (pee, poop, medicine, walk, food, treat, water, grooming, training, sleep, weight, vaccine, sick)
- **Daily count sensors** — today's counts for common event types (resets at local midnight)
- **Days-since-medicine sensor** — track medication intervals for automation reminders
- **Weight sensor** — track your dog's weight over time
- **Pawsistant Card** — built-in Lovelace card auto-registers on install; log events, view the 24-hour timeline, and track stats without leaving the dashboard
- **Multi-dog support** — add and remove dogs via services at any time
- **Timezone-aware** — daily counts use your HA instance's local timezone

- Stats row: pee count, poop count, days since medicine

**Card config options:**

| Key | Default | Description |
